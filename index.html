                    <p>Web front end development is one of the fields in IT that combines technical-analytic knowledge

                        often tasked to explore their visual arts capabilities, which is what digital design is all
                        about. So, if you are planning to become a front end developer, you should add some creative
                        sparkle to your knowledge base by integrating basic (digital) design skills.</p>

                    <h3>What Is a Front End Developer?</h3>
                    <p>A front end developer, also known as a front end web developer, is a professional responsible for
                        the design and implementation of the interface. The users require this interface so that they
                        can access the application in question. A web designer is a professional who creates a website
                        is appearance and design. And the front end developer makes sure that the design works online by
                        using coding languages such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>We should pause for a moment to clarify the differences between a front end developer, back end
                        developer, and full stack developer. Let's put this in simple terms: a front end developer is
                        responsible for the parts of an app or website that users see and interact with. A back end
                        developer takes care of the “behind the scenes” matters such as infrastructure and databases.
                        The full-stack developer is a mixture of both, a jack of all trades that can handle the whole
                        design process from the beginning to the end.</p>
                    <p>Note that there is a trend these days where the line between the front end and back end
                        development has been blurring. Primarily since many of the tasks that fall in the domain of back
                        end developers are being increasingly handled by the front end developers.</p>
                    <p>As a final aside, there are also full-stack engineers. They are full-stack developers who have
                        project management experience, adept at disciplines in the configuring, managing, and
                        maintaining computer networks and systems</p>

                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p class="lead">Actually, web front end development is considered a multi-discipline. Most companies
                        prefer to hire front end developers who are adept not only in coding but also in digital
                        psychology and design. Understanding color theory & visual patterns, and their effect on the
                        user are important. Knowledge of typography is also essential. Why is this type better than the
                        previous one I use? Which types do visitors react positively the most? These are just some of
                        the design-related questions that a web front end developer often deals with.</p>

                    <h3>Why Knowledge and Understanding of Design Matters</h3>
                    <p class="lead">A web front end developer's primary job is coding and ensuring that a website's
                        front-end - a.k.a the one that viewers see and react to - is engaging and capable of generating
                        interest leading to conversions. So, why should a front end developer possess and nurture design
                        skills? The answer is simple: a developer who understands and knows how to apply even the basic
                        design factors creates a front end that positively impacts users and their choices.

                        Additionally, combining technical and analytical expertise with creative skills catapults a
                        front end developer's portfolio ahead of other developers.

                    <h3>How to Add Creativity to Web Front End Projects</h3>
                    <p>So, how can a web front end developer add creativity to projects? Here are some simple tips and
                        suggestions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>1.Practice first then practice more.</h4>
                        <p>Before anything else, find time to practice. There are several ways you can do this</p>
                        <li>Use free online tutorial websites like freeCodeCamp.org. You can ask questions and view
                            tutorials on various front end development-related matters</li>
                        <li>Clone a website that you like. Creating a clone of a website is a good way to practice not
                            only your technical skills but also your creativity. Find time to explore your chosen
                            website. Take note of essential elements like typography, colors, media, content, and
                            structure. If this is your first time coding, choose a site that has a simple CSS and HTML
                            configuration. Pick only JavaScript website if you already have significant coding
                            experience</li>
                        <li>Join Startechup Academy. It's a community of front and back end web developers. You can ask
                            for tips, advises, and suggestions from the experts. You can also join its scheduled
                            livestream on YouTube, Facebook Live, and Twitch. All these are for FREE</li>

                        <h4>2.Pay attention to typography and color theory</h4>
                        <p>The fonts and colors you use for a website greatly impacts its visitors. There are specific
                            guidelines for using fonts - and applying color theory is highly recommended. Here are some
                            examples you should consider:</p>
                        <p class="lead">For fonts:</p>
                        <li>If you want a professional-like appearance and effect, use simple fonts</li>
                        <li>For a classic or timeless look, use display or traditional fonts</li>
                        <li>For light and fun websites, choose playful fonts</li>
                        <p>You can have two fonts on a single page as this helps create beautiful contrast. However,
                            take note of proper font pairing. For example, do not pair an old or traditional font with
                            another traditional font. Check out several online resources for the best font pairs</p>
                        <p class="lead">For colors:</p>
                        <li>For professional or corporate websites, stick to using toned down or light colors.</li>
                        <li>If you want to be consistent in your branding, use the brand's official colors.</li>
                        <li>To create a dramatic feel, go for contrasting dark colors.</li>
                        <li>For a positive and energetic effect, choose bright and cheerful colors.</li>

                        <h4>3.Create enough negative space</h4>
                        <p>The word “enough” is specified because too much negative or white space is not good for any
                            website. A negative space is what you call that empty area between page elements (such as
                            photos). If you have the right amount of white space, the website will achieve the following
                        </p>
                        <li>Less cluttered look, and elements stand out easily because of the negative space between
                            them.</li>
                        <li>More balanced because the elements are evenly spaced. The central area has more relevant
                            content and the edges are freed of clutter.</li>
                        <li>Margin is more prominent, which makes pages look clean and organized.</li>

                        <h4>4.Add the right icons and images</h4>
                        <p>Creative web front end projects need visually stimulating and engaging icons and images. So,
                            you should add some to the website you are creating. You can start by adding a menu icon.

                            If you do not have enough high-quality images, you can download some royalty-free photos
                            from Pixabay. Don't forget to consider the overall theme of the website, as well as the
                            color scheme. Your chosen images should match with or compliment them.</p>

                        <h4>5.Animate - but not too much</h4>
                        <p>Regardless of the type of website you are designing, visitors are bound to be attracted to
                            anything visual. Animation is visually entertaining, so you should consider adding some to
                            the site. It is important to note, though, that too much of it can be distracting or
                            irritating, so be sure to add just the right type and amount.</p>
                        <p>Challenge your creativity by creating an interactive image that animates when users hover
                            over it. You can also add simple animations to buttons when viewers click on it. You just
                            have to explore your creative juices to add some visual elements to your web front end
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>These are just some of the best - and doable - ways for a developer to turn web front end
                            projects into creative masterpieces. Actually, the trick is to keep practicing and creating.
                            The only way a front end developer can improve both his or her coding and design skills is
                            to keep practicing. Coding is, in itself, already creative, yet in a technical way. So, your
                            programming skills are already in you; you only need to bring them out and nurture them.</p>

                    <h2>The Disciplines of Web Design</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Fundamentally, the web is a content delivery system. In the early days of dial-up
                        modems and green-on-black monochrome monitors, text was all we could deliver with any kind of
                        speed. We listened to the sweet song of the 2400bit/s modem, tried to make the best pixel art
                        that we could, or settled for creating art from ASCII characters. And we liked it.
                    <p class="lead">Nobody liked it; it was terrible. But steadily things improved and now the web is
                        filled with streaming video and complex animations, delivered to a variety of devices with a
                        dizzying assortment of screen sizes and capabilities. Text is still the main method of
                        communication on the web and most likely it always will be, so the practice of “Web Design”
                        centers largely around how to present the written word and navigate a nested hierarchy of
                        information.
                    <p class="lead">Designing websites, whether they are simple pages or complex applications, relies on
                        a wide spectrum of design disciplines.

                    <h1>How to Become a FrontEnd Developer.</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Do not let the above list intimidate you. You can become a front end developer if
                        you follow these simple steps.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="h3">Learn CSS, JavaScript and HTML</li>
                        <p>These coding languages are the essential building blocks for web and app development, so you
                            need to learn them. Fortunately, its not a very difficult undertaking. There are lots of
                            online resources available out there that can help further your education in the coding
                            languages. For extra credit, familiarize yourself with jQuery and JavaScript Frameworks.</p>
                        <li class="h3">Get Informed</li>
                        <p>That means reading articles and books about front end development. By getting an
                            understanding of how things work on a website, you can make better sense of the various
                            coding languages. If you want to round out your learning experience, check out some videos
                            on YouTube.</p>
                        <li class="h3">Practice</li>
                        <p>Here is where the old saying “practice makes perfect” comes into play. Start small by using
                            your newfound knowledge to build small parts of a user interface, then expand slowly. If you
                            end up making mistakes, do not worry. Sometimes we learn more from our errors than we do
                            from a flawless performance.</p>
                        <li class="h3">Learn the Command Line</li>
                        <p>When pursuing a profession that has anything to do with web design, it is a good idea to get
                            at least a basic grasp of concepts like displaying files and file system navigation. On a
                            related note, you should familiarize yourself with the properties of the Shell, which is the
                            means of accessing operating system functions via a text interface.</p>
                        <li class="h3">Learn Version Control</li>
                        <p>One of the hazards of coding is having it break when you change one small thing. Even after
                            you try to rectify the problem, things are never quite the same again. That is why a good
                            front end developer learns version control. There is an impressive selection of version
                            control systems to choose from, but if you want to go with the most popular, go with Git.
                        </p>
                        <li class="h3">Enhance Your Skills</li>
                        <p>Check out some tutorials, tools, and open-source projects. Resources such as freeCodeCamp,
                            Codecademy, Bootstrap, Vue.js, CSS Layout, and Front-end Checklist exist to help you master
                            the skills of front end development without having to lay out any money for the opportunity.
                            These tools are easily accessible online and can be a much-needed boost to your front end
                            development education.</p>
